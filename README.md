# Rescript Bindings for [dbuenzli/react](https://github.com/dbuenzli/react)

The following is copied from the http://erratique.ch/software/react

[React](http://erratique.ch/software/react) is an OCaml module for functional reactive programming (FRP). It provides support to program with time varying values: declarative events and signals.

React is made of a single, independent, module and distributed under the ISC license.

Given an absolute notion of time the [Rtime](https://erratique.ch/software/rtime) module helps you to manage a timeline and provides time stamp events, delayed events and delayed signals.
